# Sudoku Validation

Small algorithm that can determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid or not

**Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:**

1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
